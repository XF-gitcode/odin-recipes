# odin-recipes project
This project was used to practice and utilise the HTML skills I've learned thus far as part of The Odin Project by creating a webpage with three cooking recipes.

To create the website I used the following skills:
* Command line basics to set up and create the project files and directories
* HTML boilerplates for each page
* HTML elements via tags to make sure the website is laid out correctly.
* HTML lists, links and images to show the recipe content consisely for easy reading and understanding.
* HTML attributes to make sure the website is accessable and easily viewed.


The following were used as reference for my recipes:

* https://www.recipetineats.com/thai-chicken-salad/
* https://www.recipetineats.com/one-pot-creamy-tomato-beef-pasta/
* https://www.recipetineats.com/nutella-stuffed-cookies/
