            <li>Pour flour, a dash of salt, and baking soda into a bowl, mix well.</li>
            <li>Microwave the butter for 30 seconds so it's melty. Stir it a little until it's a melty fluid.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, vanilla, and honey to the butter, then mix. Add the egg and mix until it's thickened. Finally, add the flower mix and stir it all together.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl with cling wrap, then refrigerate for 1.5 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, line a tray with baking paper, then add dollops of nutella 8mm~ thick.</li>
            <li>Freeze the dollops for an hour until they're firm.</li>
            <li>Once the dough is ready, roll it into a log that can be cut into 10 equal discs.</li>
            <li>Flatten the discs to be 5mm~ thin, then place a nutella disc within it upside down.</li>
            <li>Flip the cookie over, bundling up the bottom to cover the nutella disc.</li>
            <li>Shape the cookie into a 1.5cm thick round, then top with chocolate chips, be generous.</li>
            <li>Repeat this for all ten cookies, before placing them all on a paper lined tray to cook for 12 minutes at 180Â°C, 8cm apart.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies cool for 10 minutes in the tray, before removing to cool for 5 more minutes.</li>
